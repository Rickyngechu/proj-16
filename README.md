## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections

<!-- Not fully implemented -->

- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind css

### What I learned

I learnt on Developing multisign form whereby users can be able to enter their details in a form sequentially.

### Continued development

I have not fully implemented the part where user will be able to see the selected items and hover,active states.
This will be the future implementation.

### Useful resources

- [Image toggling](https://www.basedash.com/blog/how-to-change-an-image-src-with-javascript) - This helped me for learning how to toggle images using relative links and looked like dom manipulation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_items.asp) - I usually use this as my reference point for any code,css,html,js.

- [Grid blog](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/) - a blog clearly explaining the grid column auto fit layout.
